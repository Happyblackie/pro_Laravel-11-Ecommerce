The PHP GD extension is required, but is not installed.


SOLUTION
-1

For windows users

Go to php.ini file located in C:/xampp/php

Where the file type is written as "configuration settings" Once u doubleclick and it opens, search for gd. You will get something like this ;extension=gd

Uncomment it by taking out that semicolon at the beginning then save the file and close it. Then go to this path c:/xampp/php/ext Copy this file php_gd.dll To c:/windows/system32

Paste it there. Now restart ur xampp server. It'll work. Simple as that. Sorry for the long episodes ☺️☺️
